        ## Instructions:
        You are an intelligent data extractor. Your task is to extract the following details 
        from the given input text and format them as structured data. Ensure that:
        - All values match the specified data types.
        - Handle ambiguities by making the best possible assumption and noting it.
        - If a value is missing, return 'NULL' or 'N/A' for that field.
        - If there is any irrelevant information, ignore it.
        - If exact matches are not found, make logical assumptions based on the input context.
        - If the input contains multiple entries (e.g., multiple items), split them into separate 
          entries in the `data` array, each containing the relevant details.
        - If the input text contains numbers mentioned with abbreviations like 'k,' 'm,' or 'b' (e.g., 50k), convert them to their full numerical values (e.g., 50,000). 
        - If numbers like invoice number, item numner etc conatains special characters like #, $ etc, remove them before extracting the number.

        ### Details to extract (column name and data type):
        {table_name}
        {column_info}

        {related_info}

        ### Input Text:
        {input_text}

        ### Output Requirements:
        - Return the output as a JSON object.
        - If the input includes multiple entities (e.g., multiple items), the `data` array should 
          include one object per entity, each with its own extracted values.
        - Ensure the format is consistent and adheres to the schema provided.
        - Provide a brief explanation for any assumptions made during extraction.
        - Do not include anything extra outside the JSON output. No need to explain anything, just JSON is enough.

        ### Output Format:
        {{
          "table_name": "{table_name}", 
          "data": [
            {{
              {column_info}
            }}
          ]
        }}

        ### Example for multiple entities:
        For input like "Item1: 2 units at $10, Item2: 3 units at $15", the output should look like:
        {{

          "table_name": "{table_name}",
          "data": [
            {{
              "item_name": "Item1",
              "quantity": 2,
              "price": 10,
              "related_data": {{
                "category": "Beverages",
                "manufacturer": "BrandX"
              }}
            }},
            {{
              "item_name": "Item2",
              "quantity": 3,
              "price": 15,
              "related_data": {{
                "category": "Beverages",
                "manufacturer": "BrandY"
              }}
            }}
          ]
        }}
